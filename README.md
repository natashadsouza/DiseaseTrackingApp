### About

Computers have played a major part in the field of medicine, helping from early spotting to the highest possible diagnosis of a disease. This project relates to computer implemented methods for associating locations with healthcare events based on a person’s social security number or personal identification number. It includes a location-aware client device which receives the location data of the person in question, in real time. The location data is updated based on the person’s movements. The person’s healthcare related information is mapped and stored. Tracking the geographic occurrences of certain diseases with respect to each individual can definitely ascertain and restrict the spread of certain diseases and also help in handling preventive measures when the person wishes to visit another place.
